Yes I'm full blown low down
Full blown low down
Fear a sound from way down
From way on down
Make a man's backbone stiff now
That is low down
So low down

Slowly roll low, low down
Slowly roll down
Alone and our hearts slow down
Want to slow down
Ya see the devil like to get down
That is so low down
So low down

Hate and greed
Swollen and sweet
Let's start this misery
If that's where you want to be
Fear and love from down or from up above
Come to me
Come to me
I beg you please to set me free
I beg you baby
Yeah

Like a one-eyed dog's growl
When the foul wind blows around
An evil kiss on my brow
So I go down
You know I go low down

Hate and greed
My hate and my greed
Swollen and sweet
So swollen and sweet
Let's start this misery
Well if you wanna start then this is the way you ought to be
Fear and love
With our fears and all our love
From down or above
From here baby or from up above
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
And I'll let you
I'll let you set me free
