Oh, my
Life has passed me by
The country I was brought up in
Fell apart and died

Oh, no
Ooh, love no longer there
Cold wind blew away the sun
That used to warm the air

Lowdown
Ooh, I'm feeling pretty bad
Feeling like I lost the best friend
That I ever had

Lowdown
I got to find a way
Got to make the people see
The way I feel today

Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey
Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah

Yeah yeah, oh, no
Love no longer there
Cold wind blew away the sun
That used to warm the air

Lowdown
Ooh, I'm feeling pretty bad
Feeling like I lost the best friend
That I ever had

Lowdown
Oh, I got to find a way
Got to make the people see
The way I feel today

Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey
Hey, yeah
